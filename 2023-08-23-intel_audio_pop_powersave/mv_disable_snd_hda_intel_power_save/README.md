## Description

There are a couple of web sites that describe the issue:  Intel sound cards
might have power disabled to them in order to save power.  But, that means
that every time they reactivate you hear a "pop" sound.

So, a solution is to install a configuration file to disable the power
saving feature.

```
# echo 0 > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save
```

> This setting will last until you reboot. You can make it permanent by adding this text to /etc/modprobe.d/audio_disable_powersave.conf:
> ```options snd_hda_intel power_save=0```
> If youâ€™re a laptop user and you want power savings but fewer pops, you could increase the delay to a more acceptable number. For example, setting it to 60 would mean
> that the card will power down after 60 seconds of silence.
